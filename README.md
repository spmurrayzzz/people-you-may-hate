## People You May Hate

Chrome extension which auto-hides Facebook's uber-annoying 'People You May Know' pane.

Don't you find it exceedingly frustrating to constantly see people in Facebook's "People You May Know" pane who you don't know, don't like, or (in some cases) are no longer alive?

Well I certainly do, so I made this extension. Nothing magical going on here, just hides that pane when you load the page.

Cheers.
